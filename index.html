 The 2019 Masters was one that the even those outside of the golf world will remember forever. With so many players playing such good golf leading up to this years' masters, we all knew we were in for a treat. Much of the buzz was aroundwhether or not Rory Mcilroy would be able to complete the career grand slam after his collapse at the 2011 masters. However, the most hype was around none other than Tiger Woods. With 2005, being the year of his last masters victory, everyone was questioning whether he would ever win another green jacket.

 After the first two rounds of play, the leaderboard was tightly packed at the top with Tiger Woods sitting just one stroke back of the leaders heading into the weekend. Saturday was a great day of golf with Woods firing a solid 67 to put himself in striking position on Sunday, only 2 strokes back of the leader Francesco Molinari. However, going into Sunday not being at least tied for the lead was not a promising sight for Tiger as he had never come from behind to win a major in his career.

Entering Sunday's final round of the masters, all eyes were on one man, Tiger Woods. It seemed as if the entire world was rooting for him to win. After the first three holes of the final round, things were looking good for Woods, as he played them at 1-under par to move within 1 stroke of Molinari's lead which was -13. However, Woods bogeyed his next two holes to fall to three strokes back of the lead, which left Molinari three strokes ahead of the field. Tiger finished his fron nine strong, shooting a 1-under 35 even  after the  two bogeys. Things were heating up in Augusta heading into the back nine on Sunday. After making a birdie on hole 13, Tiger Woods regained a share of the lead in the final round of the masters for the first time in a long time. The roars seemed to be getting loder and louder as he made his way around the back nine. He remained tied for the lead entering the par-5 hole 15, then proceeded to birdie it to take the solo lead with just three holes to play. Entering the electric par-3 hole 16, Woods nearly holed his tee shot which set him up for a birdie to take a two stroke lead with just two holes to play. After a par on 17, Woods only needed a bogey to secure his 5th green jacket. As you would expect, he indeed completed the task and made a bogey to win the 2019 Masters. The performance by Woods will go down as one of the greatest comeback stories in sports.
